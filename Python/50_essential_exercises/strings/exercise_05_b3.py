# Check to see if the word contains two different vowels. Of ot does, we dont't
# move the first letter to the end. Because the word "wine" contains two
# different vowels ("i" and "e"), we'll add "way" to the end of it, giving us
# "wineway". By contrastm the word "wind" contains only one vowel, so we would
# move the firdt letter to the end and add "ay", rendering it "indway". How
# would you check for two different vowels in the word? (HINT: sets can come in
# handy here.)
